## How it works

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**obs: If you want to run the app on an emulator and not on your own device, you will need to have the respective emulator installed and configured first.**

#### Run the app

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Artur-Poffo/ImHere-Ignite-React-Native.git

# Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd ImHere-Ignite-React-Native

# install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run start

# After that you can press `a` to run the app in the Android emulator or `i` to run it in the IOS emulator

# Or you can test the app on your own device, for this you just need to install the Expo Go app, available for both Android and IOS and, within the app, scan the QR Code that appeared on your terminal when starting the server
```
